#Analytical Goals:

1.Customer Transaction Analysis by Area and Region:
Analyze the number of customers and transaction activity in different geographical areas (Union, Ward, Upazila, Village, Pourashava).
Compare customer distribution and transaction patterns across various regions (e.g., Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Barishal).
Understand which areas and regions have higher banking activity, helping to identify customer concentration and engagement levels.

2.Transaction Type Distribution:
Focus on two main transaction types: Deposits and Withdrawals.
Measure and compare the total amounts in deposits and withdrawals, as well as their percentages, to gain insight into customer behavior and preferences.

3.Weekly and Monthly Transaction Trends:
Calculate weekly and monthly transaction totals to observe patterns over time.
Identify periods of higher or lower transaction volumes, which could be valuable for understanding seasonal or cyclical banking behavior.

4.Deposit Trend Analysis:
Measure the week-over-week change in deposit amounts to monitor growth or decline.
Visualize this trend over multiple weeks, allowing for easy comparison of current week performance against previous weeks.
Provide insights into deposit fluctuations, helping to detect any sudden changes that may require further analysis.

5.Customer Segmentation by ID and Month:
Segment customers based on their unique Customer ID to track individual transaction history.
Monthly breakdown by customer count helps identify trends in new or repeat customer engagement over time.

#Power BI Visuals Used:

1.Bar Charts:
Area and Region Analysis: The bar charts on the left analyze customer distribution across various areas (Union, Ward, Upazila, Village, Pourashava) and regions (Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Barishal).
Total Amount by Month: The bar chart on the right displays monthly transaction totals, allowing for quick identification of high-activity months.

2.Treemap:
5-Day Withdrawal Amount: A treemap visualization presents the withdrawal amount for the past five days, offering an easy-to-read overview of daily transaction volumes. This format helps highlight daily withdrawal activity in a compact visual.

3.Pie Chart:
Transaction Type Distribution: The pie chart visualizes the proportion of deposits vs. withdrawals, making it simple to understand the overall transaction mix and identify which transaction type dominates.

4.Line and Scatter Plot:
Weekly Deposit Change Trend: The line graph at the bottom right visualizes weekly changes in deposit amounts. This chart includes both total deposits and deposit changes, showing fluctuations and trends over several weeks. It provides insights into the stability or volatility of deposits week-to-week.
Region Scatter Plot: The scatter plot below the region bar chart provides additional detail on customer distribution within each region, segmented by region ID.

5.Matrix/Table:
Customer ID, Deposit, Withdrawal, and Total: The matrix table in the middle-right displays a detailed view of each customer’s deposit, withdrawal, and total amounts, giving a customer-specific perspective on transaction history.

6.KPI Card:
Total Customers: The KPI card at the center shows the total number of customers, giving a quick, at-a-glance summary of customer base size.

7.Text Box (Summary):
The summary text box in the top-right corner provides an overview of the data preparation (ETL in MySQL), analytical goals, and key findings, giving viewers context on the dashboard’s purpose and main insights.

#Conclusion:
This dashboard integrates various Power BI visuals to provide a comprehensive view of customer transactions in online banking. The breakdown by area, region, and transaction type, combined with time-based analyses and customer segmentation, allows for detailed insights into customer behavior, transaction patterns, and weekly deposit trends.
