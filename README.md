Total customers are displayed, along with the breakdown by customer ID and monthly distribution.

4.Transaction Amounts:
Visualized transaction totals by month and transaction type, highlighting trends in deposits and withdrawals.

5.Weekly & Monthly Insights:

6.Deposit Trend Analysis:
Weekly deposit changes are tracked in a trend graph to compare current week deposits with previous weeks, providing insights into growth or decline.

7.Visual Layout:
Clean and organized visuals, including pie charts, bar graphs, and trend lines, make it easy to interpret transaction behavior across different categories.
